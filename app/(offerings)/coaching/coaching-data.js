        At ELI we believe how you live is how you lead. We don’t embrace the
        simplistic distinction between “life,” “leadership” and “executive”
        coaching. In alignment with the Internal Family Systems framework, we
        view individuals as complex beings with multiple parts. We can think of
        our “parts” as well-traveled neural pathways that developed to ensure
        our well-being.
