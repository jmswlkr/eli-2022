      <em>Welcome,</em> I’m Ali Brzenchek, the founder of the Embodied Learning
      Institute (ELI). My life’s passion is to generate a cultural shift toward
      embodied learning:  This holistic and expansive way of being embraces
      universal interconnectivity, relies on practice-based transformation,
      promotes the process of integration; and enables collective growth and
      well-being.
