        When we engage life from the space of wholehearted presence, we bring an
        unrelentless compassion for ourselves and others. This embodied state is
        grounded in understanding, generative gratitude, humility, and
        individual/collective healing.

        We all are situated within multiple interconnected and interrelated

        embodied interconnection where we recognize our habitual patterns,
        respond from a grounded space, and engage our intuition and imagination.

        Transformational relationships are built and sustained through

        collective awareness we are engaging in leadership living and learning.
